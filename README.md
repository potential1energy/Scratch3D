You will be prompted to allow an extension when loading the project, this is a custom extension I have made that implements OpenGL into scratch.

The project requires this extension to be run without the sandbox, so check the "Run extension without sandbox" box before clicking allow, the extension code is open source on github and can be viewed when you are prompted to allow the extension.
